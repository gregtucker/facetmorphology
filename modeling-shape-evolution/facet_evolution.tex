\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Facet slopes often mark the surface expression of active extensional faults. Facet slopes are basin-facing hillslopes that are aligned with the surface trace of an extensional fault (Figure~\ref{fig:facets}). In many cases, the dissection of the footwall by transverse valleys creates triangular facets: individual facet slopes that have a triangular shape in planview. 






Outline for potential short-ish paper on facet morphology:


I. Introduction

Morphology of normal-fault facets poses some interesting questions:
- variations in facet dip angle (from less than 10 degrees to over 30 degrees)
- despite planar morphology, dip angle of facet is almost always less than the dip angle of the fault
- some facets are mantled by a mostly continuous mantle of soil, whereas others are rocky and host discontinuous, patchy soil
- in some cases, the mapped fault trace lies at the base of the facet, where in others, the fault trace occurs in mid-slope, coinciding with a transition from rock to colluvium but without a clear break in slope

Literature review: facets have intrigued geoscientists both because of their striking morphology, and because of what they can reveal about tectonic motion and earthquake hazards. Various refs: Carole Petit, McCalpin, Tucker et al., 2011, etc., etc.

Need a process-based model that can account for the basic morphology of facets, and the key variations in morphology that are observed.


II. Normal-Fault Facets in the Italian Central Apennines and the central western United States

Show photos, lidar images, for facets in Wasatch and north, and in Italy


III. Cellular Model of Facet Evolution

A. Why a Cellular Model?

motivation for using this kind of model, citing Grain Hill paper and noting that process params can be pinned

B. Model Description
describe model

C. Experimental Design

goal is to determine:
- what are the necessary and sufficient conditions to reproduce the common morphology of a facet: planar with thin soil cover?
- can the model account for observed range in facet morphology and soil cover?
- what are the key controls on slope gradient, profile shape, and regolith cover fraction and thickness?


IV. Results

A. Weathering-limited facets

demonstrate that one recaptures Tucker et al. 2011 behavior when d' >> w': experiments in which the predicted angle should be 60 degrees (no weathering), 45, 30, 15.

B. Influence of d' and w'

3x3 (or maybe 5x5) plot in d' and w' space

plot of facet dip angle in d' and w' space (from talk, showing family of curves)

C. (optional) what if rock or soil can dissolve, a la Italian carbonates? (dissolution rule)

D. (optional) baselevel effects - what happens when either you have a basal stream cutting down or a hangingwall valley aggrading? This would require having a modification that would add or remove rock cells along the left edge

E. what sets the effective E vs S relation? refer back to T et al., 2011, noting restrictive assumption of slope-independent erosion rate


V. Discussion

- model accounts for basic morphology and shape. necessary and sufficient conditions for planar facet with dip angle less than fault dip: weathering of rock plus disturbance, and [something about limits, i.e., curvature appears when $d'/w' >$ ...]

- facet angle close to angle of repose is an attractor state, because below that angle, the transport rate and length scale of produced regolith goes way down

- for this reason, it should be common to observe cases where the fault trace cuts across a roughly uniform slope, marking a transition from eroding rock to aggrading colluvium

- cases that do NOT show this morphology are anomalies, likely reflecting strong baselevel control apart from simply fault slip (aggradation or incision)

- facet dip angle is set by ...

- facet soil cover depth and spatial continuity set by ...

- facets are predicted to become concave-up when ...

- to test these ideas, we need cosmos on facet slopes!


VI. Conclusions

model accounts for facet morphology as a consequence of tectonic motion, rock weathering and regolith disturbance

variations in facet morphology can be explained as a consequence of ...

erosion rate does depend on slope gradient, like thus-and-such

need cosmos to test these predictions

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
